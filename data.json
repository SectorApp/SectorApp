        "paragraph": "C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. Known for its efficiency and flexibility, it is widely used in system programming, game development, and embedded systems. C provides low-level memory access and a structured approach, making it an ideal choice for learning fundamental programming concepts.",

        "paragraph": "C supports various data types like int, float, char, and double to store different kinds of values. Variables must be declared before use, specifying their type. Constants (const) store fixed values. Proper data type selection optimizes memory usage and improves program performance, making data management an essential part of C programming.",

        "paragraph": "C uses control statements like if-else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while), and break/continue to manage program flow. These structures enable decision-making and repetition, making code efficient. Loops execute repetitive tasks, while conditionals ensure different code paths based on logic, forming the backbone of Câ€™s structured programming.",
